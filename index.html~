<h2>Speed Memory</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Speed Memory is  game where you try to match all cards in time.
<p>Note: This is a polish of digital assignment #8.\nGame timing mechanics improved. Additional animation and sounds added. Bubble size changed and red bubbles added to lower game difficulty. Thirty redundant methods removed. Additional helper methods added.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should experience a sense of urgency as they play as they have a limited time to complete all the matches. They should also use their memory to help them succeed.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is in the matching and memorization genres.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Players move the avatar with the arrow keys. The spacebar key will flip a card over. If two cards are the same when flipped they are removed from play. Clear bubbles will slow down the player for 5 seconds if they touch the avatar. Red bubbles will speed the player up for 5 seconds. Red bubbles protect the player from clear bubbles for a limited time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The prototype goal is to show the matching and memorization mechanics and see how players react to time constraints. The prototype gives the opportunity to observe player behavior by changing the amount of time available. The game also focuses on the memorization, puzzle, and matching themes from last week's class.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The game gives players feedback with sounds and the removal of matched cards. Players do not click on the cards directly but instead have to move an avatar character to each card.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The world is filled with giant cards. When two of the same are turned face up they disappear and noises play. Perhaps this is an abstract realm of a mad god?
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are the avatar. You awaken in a world of cards that you can flip. You feel like you have to flip them and soon. You are compelled to do this though you do not know why. Get flipping!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone. Strong memory skills benefit all of humankind.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
You have 169 seconds to beat the game. Play time will be no longer than this time amount.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The standard memory game strategies apply here. In addition, since all the bubbles share the same global timer it is beneficial to pop as many clear bubbles as you can while you are in the slowdown or speedup state. This is because it will not add to the 5 second global timer. Bubbles should try to be avoided until they are needed for a speed boost or they can be destroyed by a red bubble shield.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Card images taken from Google Images icon search. Explosion sprite sheet taken from game development public domain resources. Shield image taken from Google image search. All other image assets made by internal design team. Audio files taken from public domain sources.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Any memory game is close to this game. This game is also influenced by puzzle games with timers.
